# Port activity DB

To run locally first checkout and run the digitraffic-marine database from
[https://github.com/tmfg/digitraffic-marine](https://github.com/tmfg/digitraffic-marine)

To run the incremental update scripts under ./update, first run the SQL script
in the file create-user.sql as marine, then run `update-db.sh`

**The current file and directory structure must be preserved for CI purposes!**
