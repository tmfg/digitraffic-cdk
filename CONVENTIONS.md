# Conventions foobar

# Dependencies

Use the caret ^ semver syntax to allow updates of minor and patch versions if
possible, otherwise lock the dependency version.

## Naming conventions

The CI server expects your app to follow these conventions.

- stack configuration goes under bin/ named after the app directory plus
  -app.ts, e.g. swagger-joiner.app.ts
- stacks are named after your app in camelcase plus app name and environment,
  e.g. SwaggerJoinerSomethingTest
- use the env properties to specify the account id and region
