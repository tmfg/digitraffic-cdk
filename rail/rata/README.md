## Differences with other stacks

Rail-stacks imports a lot of existing resources from AWS due to historical
reasons. It might be difficult to make alterations to some resources that were
imported and not created by the stack. In many cases you might want to consider
replacing resources with new ones rather than modifying the existing ones.
